# Gulp-starter

Starter should help to create the front-end layer of the application.

Please use develop branch.

### Required

```sh
npm v5.2.0
node.js v6.11.4
```

### Installation

```sh
$ npm i
```

### Development

This command will launch the server synchronization task and launch a 'watch' that will compile the code in real time.

```sh
$ gulp
```

If you want run only one task you can use:

```sh
$ gulp sass
```

Complied only sass files to css.

```sh
$ gulp scripts
```

Complied only js files.

```sh
$ gulp pug
```

Complied only pug files to html.

```sh
$ gulp clean
```

This command will clean all output folder, in this case 'public/'.
